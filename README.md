# Lab 1
```Write a Java Program that will collect your basic details that fall into different data types and displays them.
After the details have been displayed, with the help of conditional statements, check if the gender of the user is 'm' or 'f'. It should print "MALE" for 'm' and "FEMALE" for 'f'.
Assume that you can divide the states among India into four different regions (North, South, East, and West). If you are from the southern part of India; with the help of a switch statement, it should display The Student is from the southern states of India", along with the basic details.
```

# Lab 2
```
You are supposed to create a menu-driven program that has the following menu options:
Enter a name
Search for a name
Remove a name
Show all names

# Note:
The menu-driven program has to be made with the help of a do-while loop and switch-case statements.

# Constraints:
The names collected must be stored in an array with a max length of 1024.
The names in the array should be UNIQUE; no duplicate entries are expected!
Provide necessary validations that the user enters only valid names that are not going to be repeated.
Removing a name should not create empty space inside the array!
Format your results properly!!
```

# Lab 3
```
Create a java program that performs the following operation:
The program should collect an integer array from the user
After the array is entered, you need to create a menu of items
Find the Mean Value
Find the Median Value
Find the Mode Value
From the user-given array.
The program should have a minimum of 3 functions apart from the main function; each of the functions implements the Mean, Median, and Mode computation by accepting the array user has entered as a parameter and returning the value as a result. From the main method, you will display the result.
```

# Lab 4
